# procgen_experiments
Experiments in procedural generation in python as a programming exercise. Everything in here in inefficient and wrong.

I was reading a book about the development of Rogue and Roguelikes and wondered if I, as a complete amateur, could use the
far greater computer resources available today to replicate the procedural map generation techniques. Also, I just wanted to say
that I had procedurally generated something.

This actual code is pretty useless but I figure that any experience is good experience.
